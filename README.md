# Senior-Project

The following is a brief description of the files in this repository.

NOTE: The save files of what my models learned so far (state data) were too large to upload to github, thus, if the user wishes to run my code without having to train for hours first, I have turned in the files seperately. 

* Chaucer - My dataset of interlinear translations from _The Canterbury Tales_.

* ChaucerMaker.py - Code that splits Chaucer to put into my main datasets.

* DE-PDE.py - The first translator I made by watching a tutorial on how to make a neural machine translator by Aladdin Persson, most of my code for Middle English to Present Day English was adapted from this. Here is the tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoGUlvhRYpk.

* ME-PDE3.py - The primary code that runs my neural machine translator. Most of this is adapted from open source code I got from the tutorial video.

* test2016.me - My ME test data.

* test2016.pde - My PDE test data.

* train.me - My ME train data.

* train.pde - My PDE train data.

* utils.py - Extra code for the German translator. 

* utils3.py - Nearly the same extra code but different save files for the ME translator.

* val.me - My ME validation data.

* val.pde - My PDE validation data.
